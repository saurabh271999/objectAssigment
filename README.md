This document provides a concise overview of essential JavaScript object concepts for quick revision and practical understanding. 💻✨

🧱 Creating Objects
Objects in JavaScript are used to store data in key–value pairs. You can create them using curly braces {} and assign properties like name, age, or city.

🔁 Looping Through Objects
To access each property of an object:

Use for...in for simple looping 🔄

Or use Object.keys(), Object.entries(), or Object.values() with forEach() for more advanced control ⚙️

📦 Returning Objects from Functions
Functions can return objects, allowing you to generate reusable and dynamic data structures. These returned objects can also include methods (functions inside objects) 🧠📤

🚫 Removing Duplicates
To remove duplicate values from arrays, you can use a Set, which automatically ensures uniqueness. Then, use the spread operator to convert it back to an array ✅📚

🧪 Comparing Objects
Avoid using === or == to compare objects directly, because it checks if they are the same reference in memory — not if their contents are equal 😅❌

Use JSON.stringify() for simple comparisons (only if key order is the same), or write a deep comparison function that checks each key and value 🔍🧮

🧠 Deep Comparison
For accurate comparison:

Check if both objects have the same number of keys

Then compare each key's value manually This ensures both structure and content are identical ✅🧩

⚠️ Important Notes
Two identical objects in structure and values are still not equal with === unless they point to the same memory reference 🔗

Mixing objects with arrays is powerful for building dynamic UIs, working with APIs, or managing user data 📊📦
